# PowerShell script | SyncFolder

Synchronize a folder (with subfolder/files) in one direction - optional over a PSSession.

## Description

Synchronize a folder (with subfolder/files) in one direction - optional over a PSSession. 
The follwoing options are available:
      
1. Synchronize two folders on your lokal system
2. Synchronize a folder from a remote PC over a PSSession with your local system 
3. Synchronize a folder to a remote PC over a PSSession with your local system 

The advantage of the last 2 points is, that you can synchronize a folder with a remote PC which is not necessarily a member of an Active Directory domain and without connecting a network share . Only PowerShell-Remoting must be enabled and if you are not in the same subnet, you have to add on both sides the other client as TrustedHost (WinRM).
